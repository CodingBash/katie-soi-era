To be able to get the project from GitHub and begin work after added as collaborator, you will need JDK 1.8 . You will also need the IDE called Spring Tool Suite (STS). Here is a YouTube video I found showing how to install JDK and STS and includes the link to download both in the description: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gPF3awwQEs . Here is a YouTube video showing how to import a GitHub Maven project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xFzftkdycI .

To run the project, right click on the root folder (katie_soi_era), click Run As, then click Run On Server. After some processing it should open up a browser with the web application.
